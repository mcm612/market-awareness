# Module 1: What Are Futures?

## The Simple Explanation
Think of futures like making dinner reservations. You're agreeing today to "buy" a table at a restaurant next month at a specific "price" (time slot). The restaurant locks in your spot, you lock in the time - even if the restaurant gets more popular (expensive) later.

## Futures vs Stocks - The Key Differences

## Why Stock Traders Love Futures
- Capital efficiency: Control more with less money
- Diversification: Trade oil, gold, bonds - not just stocks
